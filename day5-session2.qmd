## Some logical operators

-   == (does this match?)

-   != (do these NOT match?)

-   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

-   &, \|

```{r}

# Does 4 mathch 5? 
4 == 5

# Does 4 match 4? 
4 == 4

# Does 4 NOT MATCH 5? 
4 != 5

# Dose 4 match "4"?
4 == "4"

# with assigned variables:
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog

# Is dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20?

dog > cat | cat < 20

# is dog less than cat AND cat == 10 ?
dog  > 0.5 * cat 

dog < cat & cat >2 & 4 >= dog
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = mpg, color = wt)) +
  labs(x="Car weight (1000 pound)", y= "mpg", title = "Car weight efficiency relationship")
```
